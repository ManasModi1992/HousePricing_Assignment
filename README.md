## General Information
- A US-based housing company has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- It has given us the data for market analysis in csv format
- Prospective Properties looking in the market
- Need to build regression model using regularisation 
- We need to predict the actual value of the prospective properties 
- Help them whetherto invest or not
- Find out variables whichare significant in predicting the price of a house
- Find out the variables which describe the price of a house.
-  We need to find the optimal lambda value for ridge and lasso regression.
- Solve Subjective questions for the assignment

## Conclusions
- Lasso Regression is better than Ridge Regression as it provides the capability of taking some varibale coeffficients to 0 and also helps in feature selections 
- Major dependent affecting indepedendent variables were  identified to check on model
- Best Alpha or lamda value for Ridge and Lasso was identified as 5 and.0001 respectively
- R-Sqaured, RSS, MSE, RMSE were also calculated showing similar performance while changing alpha for Ridge and Lasso Regression
